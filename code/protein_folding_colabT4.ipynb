        "ESMFold ([paper link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500902v2)) is a recently released protein folding model from FAIR. Unlike other protein folding models, it does not require external databases or search tools to predict structures, and is up to 60X faster as a result.\n",
        "\n",
        "The port to the HuggingFace `transformers` library is even easier to use, as we've removed the dependency on tools like `openfold` - once you `pip install transformers`, you're ready to use this model!\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that all the code that follows will be running the model **locally**, rather than calling an external API. This means that no rate limiting applies here - you can predict as many structures as your computer can handle.\n",
        "\n",
        "In testing, we found that ESMFold needs about 16-24GB of GPU memory to run well, depending on protein length. This may be too much for the smaller free GPUs on Colab."

By default, the model assumes that you've passed it one linear, contiguous chain - in other words, if you give it a peptide with 100 amino acids, it will assume the `position_ids` are just `[0, 1, ..., 98, 99]` unless you tell it otherwise.\n",
